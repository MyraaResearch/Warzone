problem statement demande us to build text classifier that would get place text in appropriate box after reading the text.We have follwed supervised machine learning approach. training is done by standford open source library.open source library then would give us trained data after using ur python code. then we place that text in our trained data file. Next, is test data is any file from anyplace when we place would give us output in appropriate basket. The software is quite accurate in predicting the data.  The after 11 hours of coding we finally created a working model and meet our goal.
